  <h3>Equipment Details</h3>

  <ul class="muted">
    <li><b>Manufacturer:</b> Emerson</li>
    <li><b>Model:</b> Rosemount 3051</li>
    <li><b>Type:</b> Differential Pressure Transmitter</li>
    <li><b>Application:</b> Flow measurement (DP)</li>
    <li><b>Mounting:</b> Field mounted with 3-valve manifold</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= PLANT ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Plant / Environment</h3>

  <p class="muted">
    Refinery process unit. Outdoor installation.
    Analyzer shelter shutdown occurred during night hours with ambient
    temperature drop.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= PROBLEM ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

  <p class="muted">
    After a planned unit shutdown and restart, the Rosemount 3051 DP transmitter
    indicated a constant positive value even when the process was at zero flow.
    Re-calibration temporarily corrected the issue, but the problem reappeared
    after the next shutdown.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= SYMPTOMS ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Observed Symptoms</h3>

  <ul class="muted">
    <li>DP reading not returning to zero after shutdown</li>
    <li>Zero shift increased after every shutdown</li>
    <li>Process flow physically confirmed as zero</li>
    <li>Transmitter diagnostics showed no internal fault</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= WRONG ASSUMPTIONS ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Initial Assumptions (Incorrect)</h3>

  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Transmitter sensor drift</li>
    <li>Electronics aging</li>
    <li>Need for transmitter replacement</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section class="panel">
  <h3>Root Cause Analysis</h3>

  <p class="muted">
    Detailed inspection of the impulse lines and manifold revealed that the
    <b>equalizing valve was not fully closed</b>.
    During shutdown, when process pressure decayed and ambient temperature
    changed, partial equalization allowed pressure imbalance between the
    high-pressure and low-pressure sides.
  </p>

  <p class="muted">
    This trapped differential pressure caused the transmitter to settle at a
    false zero point. Recalibration masked the problem but did not eliminate
    the physical cause.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= CORRECTIVE ACTION ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Corrective Action</h3>

  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Fully closed the equalizing valve</li>
    <li>Verified correct manifold valve sequence</li>
    <li>Drained impulse lines to remove trapped pressure</li>
    <li>Performed zero calibration only after physical correction</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ================= RESULT ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Result</h3>

  <p class="muted">
    After corrective action, the transmitter consistently returned to true zero
    following shutdowns. No further zero shift was observed, and recalibration
    frequency was eliminated.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ================= LESSONS ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

  <ul class="muted">
    <li>Most DP zero shifts are installation-related, not transmitter faults</li>
    <li>Equalizing valve position is critical during shutdown</li>
    <li>Never recalibrate before confirming manifold and impulse line condition</li>
    <li>Replacing transmitters does not fix physical installation problems</li>
  </ul>

<!-- ================= FIELD RULE ================= -->
<section class="panel">
  <h3>Technician Rule</h3>

  <p class="muted">
    If a transmitter shows zero shift after shutdown,
    check the manifold and impulse lines before touching calibration.
