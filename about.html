    <h3>Why InstMates?</h3>

    <p>
      Instrument and analyzer technicians often work in isolation,
      relying on manuals, informal groups, and trial-and-error methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      InstMates brings structured knowledge, real troubleshooting cases,
      and professional visibility into one focused ecosystem.
