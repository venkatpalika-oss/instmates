      GC baseline drifting after column change

    <p>
      After replacing the GC column, a continuous baseline drift is observed.
      Oven temperature is stable and detector gases are within limits.
      Calibration completes successfully, but the baseline keeps drifting.
    </p>

    <p>
      What parameters or checks should be done next?
    </p>

      <p>
        After column replacement, baseline drift is commonly due to
        column conditioning. Check whether the column has been baked
        at the recommended temperature for sufficient time.

      <p>
        Also verify:

        <li>Carrier gas purity and leaks</li>
        <li>Detector reference flow stability</li>

    <!-- ANSWER 2 -->
    <article class="card">
      <p>
        Baseline drift can also occur if the column was exposed to
        moisture or oxygen during installation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I recommend purging the column with carrier gas before heating
        and checking EPC pressure stability during analysis.
