# CEMS TROUBLESHOOTING KNOWLEDGE
Scope: Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS)
Applies to: O2, CO, CO2, NOx, SO2 analyzers (generic logic)

---

## CARD 01
### FAULT
CEMS analyzer shows zero reading continuously

### CONDITIONS
- Analyzer powered ON
- No alarm present
- Reading stuck at zero

### INTERPRETATION
Analyzer is running but sample gas is not reaching the measurement cell.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Sample probe blocked
- Sample pump not running
- Condensation in sample line
- Zero gas valve stuck ON

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check probe for blockage or ash buildup
2. Verify sample pump operation and flow
3. Inspect sample line for condensation
4. Confirm zero gas solenoid is CLOSED

### FIELD RULE
Zero reading without alarm usually means no sample flow

---

## CARD 02
### FAULT
Analyzer reading drifting slowly upward or downward

### CONDITIONS
- Gradual drift
- No sudden jumps
- Calibration overdue

### INTERPRETATION
Sample conditioning or analyzer stability issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Moisture carryover
- Sample cooler inefficiency
- Analyzer aging
- Ambient temperature influence

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check sample cooler outlet temperature
2. Inspect moisture trap and drain
3. Verify enclosure temperature
4. Review last calibration date

### FIELD RULE
Slow drift usually means conditioning problem, not process change

---

## CARD 03
### FAULT
Calibration fails but process reading looks normal

### CONDITIONS
- Calibration alarm
- Process value believable

### INTERPRETATION
Calibration gas is not reaching analyzer correctly.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Calibration gas cylinder empty
- Wrong calibration gas connected
- Cal gas pressure low
- Solenoid valve not switching

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check calibration gas pressure
2. Confirm correct gas cylinder
3. Manually test calibration solenoid
4. Inspect calibration tubing

### FIELD RULE
Good process + failed calibration = calibration path issue

---

## CARD 04
### FAULT
Analyzer shows sudden high reading spike

### CONDITIONS
- Sudden jump
- Returns to normal later

### INTERPRETATION
Transient disturbance, not true emission change.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Condensation slug entering analyzer
- Probe temperature drop
- Sample pump fluctuation
- Electrical interference

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Inspect sample line for water
2. Check probe heater status
3. Verify sample pump stability
4. Check grounding and shielding

### FIELD RULE
Sudden spikes are usually sampling disturbances

---

## CARD 05
### FAULT
Analyzer shows low reading compared to reference

### CONDITIONS
- Stable but lower than expected
- Calibration OK

### INTERPRETATION
Sample dilution or leakage.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Sample line leak
- Dilution air ingress
- Low probe insertion depth
- Filter partially blocked

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Leak check sample line
2. Inspect probe mounting
3. Verify filters condition
4. Compare with manual sampling if available

### FIELD RULE
Low stable reading usually means dilution

---

## CARD 06
### FAULT
Frequent analyzer maintenance alarm

### CONDITIONS
- Repeated maintenance warnings
- Analyzer otherwise running

### INTERPRETATION
Preventive maintenance overdue or harsh sampling conditions.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Dirty optics or sensor
- Excessive dust load
- High moisture content
- Poor probe location

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Inspect analyzer cell or optics
2. Review probe location suitability
3. Check dust and moisture load
4. Increase maintenance frequency if required

### FIELD RULE
Repeated maintenance alarms indicate sampling environment issue

---

## CARD 07
### FAULT
Analyzer reading frozen (not updating)

### CONDITIONS
- No change in reading
- No active alarm

### INTERPRETATION
Signal processing or communication issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Analyzer software hang
- Signal output frozen
- Communication failure

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check analyzer display vs output signal
2. Verify signal update at PLC/DCS
3. Restart analyzer if safe
4. Check communication cables

### FIELD RULE
Frozen value without alarm often needs restart

---

## CARD 08
### FAULT
High O2 reading during normal combustion

### CONDITIONS
- O2 higher than expected
- Other analyzers normal

### INTERPRETATION
Air ingress or probe issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Probe leak
- Sample line leak
- Incorrect probe location
- Reference air mixing

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Leak test probe and sample line
2. Verify probe sealing
3. Check probe position in duct
4. Confirm no reference air ingress

### FIELD RULE
High O2 usually means air leakage

---

## CARD 09
### FAULT
Analyzer shows erratic or noisy signal

### CONDITIONS
- Fluctuating readings
- Poor signal stability

### INTERPRETATION
Electrical noise or moisture interference.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Poor grounding
- Moisture in sample
- Power supply issues
- Signal cable interference

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Inspect grounding
2. Check sample moisture
3. Verify power quality
4. Inspect signal cable routing

### FIELD RULE
Noise is usually electrical or moisture-related

---

## CARD 10
### FAULT
CEMS goes to fault after power failure

### CONDITIONS
- Fault after restart
- Worked before power trip

### INTERPRETATION
Initialization or warm-up issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Incomplete warm-up
- Sensor not initialized
- Configuration reset
- UPS failure

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Allow full warm-up time
2. Verify sensor initialization
3. Check configuration status
4. Inspect UPS health

### FIELD RULE
Power failures expose weak startup conditions
