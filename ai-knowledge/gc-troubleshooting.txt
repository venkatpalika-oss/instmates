GC TROUBLESHOOTING KNOWLEDGE

Platform reference: Yokogawa GC8000
Scope: Online process gas chromatographs (generic logic)

CARD 01
FAULT

GC shows negative peaks

CONDITIONS

Detector: FID

Baseline: Flat and stable

Flame: ON

INTERPRETATION

Negative peaks do not indicate a process issue.
This condition indicates detector signal logic inversion or integration direction error.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

FID signal polarity set to inverted

Peak direction configured as negative

Signal wiring polarity swapped after maintenance

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Go to Analyzer Setup → Detector → FID → Signal Polarity

Set polarity to NORMAL

Go to Chromatogram / Integration

Set peak direction to POSITIVE

If issue started after maintenance:

Verify FID signal + / – wiring at detector and I/O card

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Flame instability

Gas ratio problem

Column fault

FIELD RULE

FID + flat baseline + negative peaks = configuration issue (almost always)

CARD 02
FAULT

No peaks detected but baseline normal

CONDITIONS

Baseline flat

Analyzer running

No component peaks

INTERPRETATION

GC electronics are healthy. Sample is not reaching the column.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Sample valve not switching

Zero or calibration gas stuck ON

Sample line blocked

Sample pressure missing

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Observe sample valve switching

Confirm process gas presence at inlet

Inspect sample filter and probe

Verify zero / cal solenoids are CLOSED

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Detector failure

Signal card fault

FIELD RULE

Flat baseline + no peaks = sample path issue

CARD 03
FAULT

Baseline drifting slowly up or down

CONDITIONS

Peaks present

Slow continuous drift

INTERPRETATION

Flow or temperature stability problem.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Carrier or reference flow imbalance

Reference gas leak

Oven temperature instability

Regulator creep

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Verify carrier and reference pressures

Check for leaks

Compare oven actual vs set temperature

Observe ambient temperature influence

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Column damage

Integration error

FIELD RULE

Slow drift indicates flow or temperature instability

CARD 04
FAULT

Peaks present but area suddenly reduced

CONDITIONS

Retention time unchanged

Peak height/area reduced

INTERPRETATION

Component dilution or partial restriction.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Sample pressure drop

Partial blockage in sample line

Filter clogging

Split ratio change

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Compare sample pressure with historical value

Inspect filters and regulators

Verify injection / split settings

Check for upstream leaks

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Detector sensitivity loss

Calibration gas issue

FIELD RULE

Area drop without RT shift = sample delivery problem

CARD 05
FAULT

Random noise or spiky baseline

CONDITIONS

Erratic baseline

Poor peak integration

INTERPRETATION

Electrical interference or contamination.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Poor grounding

Moisture ingress

Unstable flame

Power quality issues

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Inspect analyzer grounding

Check sample conditioning for moisture

Confirm flame stability

Verify UPS and power supply

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Process fluctuation

FIELD RULE

Noise is electrical or moisture-related, not chemical

CARD 06
FAULT

FID flame ON but no response

CONDITIONS

Flame confirmed

Baseline flat

No peaks

INTERPRETATION

Ionization or signal path failure.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Jet blocked

Collector contaminated

Signal cable disconnected

Wrong detector configured in software

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Inspect and clean FID jet

Clean collector

Verify signal cable continuity

Confirm detector type set as FID

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Hydrogen / air ratio issue (if flame stable)

FIELD RULE

Flame ON does not guarantee signal integrity

CARD 07
FAULT

Retention time shift for all components

CONDITIONS

All peaks shifted

Peak order unchanged

INTERPRETATION

Column operating condition change.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Carrier flow deviation

Oven temperature error

EPC drift

Column aging

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Verify carrier flow

Check oven temperature accuracy

Compare EPC set vs actual

Review recent maintenance actions

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Sample composition change

FIELD RULE

Global RT shift = flow or temperature issue

CARD 08
FAULT

One component missing, others normal

CONDITIONS

Selective peak loss

Other peaks healthy

INTERPRETATION

Selective separation or adsorption issue.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Column damage

Valve timing issue

Adsorption of heavy component

Liquid carryover

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Review valve timing sequence

Inspect for liquid ingress

Check column history

Compare with calibration chromatogram

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Detector failure

FIELD RULE

Single missing peak points to column or valve logic

CARD 09
FAULT

Calibration fails but process reading reasonable

CONDITIONS

Calibration alarm

Process values believable

INTERPRETATION

Calibration path problem, not analyzer accuracy.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Wrong calibration gas connected

Calibration gas pressure low

Solenoid valve malfunction

Incorrect calibration assignment

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Confirm correct calibration cylinder

Verify calibration gas pressure

Check solenoid operation

Review calibration logic assignment

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Process measurement failure

FIELD RULE

Good process + failed cal = cal path issue

CARD 10
FAULT

Analyzer fault after power failure

CONDITIONS

Fault immediately after restart

Worked before trip

INTERPRETATION

Initialization or configuration issue exposed by restart.

MOST PROBABLE CAUSES

Detector not reinitialized

EPC not stabilized

Configuration corruption

UPS malfunction

FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE

Confirm analyzer warm-up completed

Verify detector initialization status

Check EPC pressures

Reload known good configuration if required

WHAT THIS IS NOT

Sudden hardware failure (rare)

FIELD RULE

Power failures reveal weak configurations
