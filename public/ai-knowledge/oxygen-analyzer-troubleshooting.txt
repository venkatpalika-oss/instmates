# OXYGEN ANALYZER TROUBLESHOOTING KNOWLEDGE
Scope: Process Oxygen Analyzers
Applies to: Zirconia, Paramagnetic, Electrochemical (generic field logic)

---

## CARD 01
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer shows constant high O2 reading

### CONDITIONS
- Reading higher than expected
- Process conditions normal
- Other analyzers stable

### INTERPRETATION
False high O2 due to air ingress or sampling issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Sample line leak
- Probe leak
- Ambient air ingress
- Improper probe insertion

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Leak check sample line and fittings
2. Inspect probe sealing and gasket
3. Verify probe insertion depth
4. Confirm no open vents or drains

### FIELD RULE
High O2 usually means air leakage, not process change

---

## CARD 02
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer reading drifting slowly

### CONDITIONS
- Gradual drift
- No sudden spikes
- Calibration overdue or unstable

### INTERPRETATION
Sensor aging or sample conditioning issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Sensor aging
- Reference air instability
- Temperature variation
- Moisture in sample

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check analyzer and probe temperature
2. Verify reference air flow (if applicable)
3. Inspect moisture trap or dryer
4. Review last calibration date

### FIELD RULE
Slow drift usually indicates sensor or conditioning issue

---

## CARD 03
### FAULT
Zirconia oxygen analyzer shows zero or very low reading

### CONDITIONS
- Analyzer powered ON
- Process known to contain oxygen
- Reading near zero

### INTERPRETATION
Sensor not active or heater problem.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Zirconia heater failure
- Insufficient warm-up
- Power supply issue
- Sensor damage

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check heater status and temperature
2. Allow full warm-up time
3. Verify power supply to sensor
4. Inspect sensor condition

### FIELD RULE
Zirconia sensor must be hot to measure oxygen

---

## CARD 04
### FAULT
Paramagnetic oxygen analyzer shows unstable reading

### CONDITIONS
- Fluctuating value
- No process fluctuation
- Noise visible

### INTERPRETATION
Mechanical or flow instability.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Sample flow instability
- Vibration
- Moisture in sample
- Dirty measuring cell

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Verify constant sample flow
2. Check analyzer mounting for vibration
3. Inspect moisture traps
4. Clean measuring cell if required

### FIELD RULE
Paramagnetic analyzers are sensitive to flow and vibration

---

## CARD 05
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer calibration fails

### CONDITIONS
- Calibration alarm
- Process reading appears reasonable

### INTERPRETATION
Calibration gas not reaching analyzer correctly.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Calibration gas empty
- Wrong calibration gas connected
- Cal gas pressure low
- Solenoid valve not switching

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Verify calibration gas cylinder
2. Check calibration gas pressure
3. Test calibration solenoid operation
4. Inspect calibration tubing

### FIELD RULE
Good process reading + failed calibration = calibration path issue

---

## CARD 06
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer response very slow

### CONDITIONS
- Reading changes delayed
- Process changes known

### INTERPRETATION
Sample transport delay or restriction.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Long sample line
- Partial blockage
- Low sample flow
- Moisture condensation

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Check sample flow rate
2. Inspect sample line length and routing
3. Look for condensation
4. Inspect filters and probes

### FIELD RULE
Slow response usually means sampling delay

---

## CARD 07
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer reading frozen

### CONDITIONS
- No reading change
- No active alarm

### INTERPRETATION
Signal processing or communication issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Analyzer software hang
- Signal output frozen
- Communication fault

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Compare analyzer display vs output signal
2. Check signal at PLC/DCS
3. Restart analyzer if safe
4. Inspect communication cables

### FIELD RULE
Frozen reading often needs restart or signal check

---

## CARD 08
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer shows noisy or unstable signal

### CONDITIONS
- Fluctuating readings
- Poor stability

### INTERPRETATION
Electrical interference or moisture ingress.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Poor grounding
- Moisture in sample
- Power supply issues
- Signal cable interference

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Inspect grounding
2. Check sample moisture
3. Verify power quality
4. Inspect signal cable routing

### FIELD RULE
Noise is usually electrical or moisture-related

---

## CARD 09
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer reading lower than expected

### CONDITIONS
- Stable but low value
- Calibration OK

### INTERPRETATION
Sample dilution or restriction.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Sample leak (air dilution)
- Blocked filter
- Low sample flow
- Improper probe placement

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Leak check sample system
2. Inspect filters
3. Verify sample flow
4. Confirm probe position

### FIELD RULE
Low stable O2 often indicates dilution or restriction

---

## CARD 10
### FAULT
Oxygen analyzer goes to fault after power failure

### CONDITIONS
- Fault after restart
- Analyzer worked before trip

### INTERPRETATION
Initialization or warm-up issue.

### MOST PROBABLE CAUSES
- Incomplete warm-up
- Sensor not initialized
- Configuration reset
- UPS failure

### FIELD CHECK SEQUENCE
1. Allow full warm-up time
2. Verify sensor initialization
3. Check configuration status
4. Inspect UPS condition

### FIELD RULE
Power failures expose startup weaknesses
